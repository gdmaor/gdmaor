## Background
The second album from the band coming just 8 months after their debut platter, and it shows. This album had the feel of a record rushed somewhat but that's not to say it was a disaster. 

Far from it. There are no singles included on this album, can you imagine that happening today? But that just demonstrates how prolific the band at that time were at assembled their own material.

## The Songs
Again, a record with a mixture of originals and covers. We get the timeless 'Roll Over Beethoven' and 'Money', I defy anyone not to know these songs, the exuberant 'All My Loving' and 'I Wanna Be Your Man', a song that a fledgling **Rolling Stones** covered with great success. 

## In Summary
The album is notable for the first writing credit for George Harrison with 'Don't Bother Me' which is a fairly unexceptional number, but in the years to come Harrison would become a formidable songwriting foil for Lennon and McCartney.

Some of the material lacks the vitality of the debut, but that's hardly surprising as the band back then were practically working every single day, either recording or touring, but the next album was for me anyway, the real game-changer.
