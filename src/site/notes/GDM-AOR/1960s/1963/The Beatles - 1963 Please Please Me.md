## Background
Having had success with the singles 'Love Me Do' and more importantly 'Please, Please Me', the Beatles went into the studio (in those days it was simply EMI Studios before being renamed Abbey Road) to record their debut album. Producer **George Martin** (effectively the Fifth Beatle) asked the band what they had for putting down onto vinyl. 

The result, well in essence their stage act which then contained a mixture of originals and carefully chosen covers. So on Monday, 11th February 1963, yes we can be that accurate, The Beatles began working their way through their live set song by song and finally finishing up at 10:45 pm - less than 13 hours later, quite incredible!

## The Songs
The results are astonishing and there are songs that to this day still resonate with the record-buying public. The storming opener 'I Saw Her Standing There' and the visceral 'Twist And Shout', but elsewhere there are some many gems from the hummable 'Do You Want To Know A Secret' and the first go at a Beatles ballad, 'Misery'.

## In Summary
This record laid down the foundations for the albums to come over the next few years when Beatlemania became a cultural phenomenon practically worldwide and saw the band reach incredible heights both artistically and commercially.
