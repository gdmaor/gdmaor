## Background
Love it or hate it, Brass Rock had a brief stretch of popularity in the late 1960's before dropping off around 1975. Largely but not exclusively an American movement, there were numerous bands that released decent albums during this period.

These included **The Flock**, **Dreams**, **Chase**, **Tower of Power**, **Pig Iron** and others. The hands down commercial kings of horn fronted rock were **Chicago** and New York's Blood Sweat And Tears.

Yes, **Chicago** had more hits and a much longer run but BS and T were different. Their music was a savoury blend of jazz, classical and pop.

Their catalog included both originals and innovative covers from a wildly diverse range of sources including **James Taylor** and Russian composer **Sergei Prokofiev**.

## The Songs
For my money this is Blood Sweat And Tears finest hour and the first with soulful singer David Clayton-Thomas. The amalgam of styles is astonishing. It opens with the pastoral and familiar **Erik Satie** piece 'Variations On A Theme' which is a stroke of genius.

After a brief pause, the band rock-up the same melody in true Tears style with flashy horns and spacey percussion which strangely skirts avant-garde. 'Smiling Faces' gives us the first vocal track with Thomas and it's a winner. Steve Katz's lead on the sumptuous 'Sometimes In Winter' is one of the most beautiful songs they ever put to tape. It sounds like a drowsy version of **The Left Banke**.

I always had a difficult time with 'And When I Die' as it mixes Broadway show tunes ('Oklahoma' comes to mind) with gospel and offbeat blues pop. Much to my amazement it was one of the albums biggest hits and pushed all the way to 4 on the Billboard charts.

More to my liking is the wonderful **Billie Holiday** cover 'God Bless The Child'. It was never released as a single. I do remember hearing it on the radio and seeing the band perform it on TV when I was a youngster. Nice stuff.

But the follow-up 'Spinning Wheel' is the tune that put Blood Sweat And Tears on the map. Written by Thomas, it's typical of the time with lots of trippy imagery, calliope and a delicious hook. It hit number 2 on the charts.

So did the brilliant cover of 'You Made Me So Very Happy' which like **The Association**'s 'Windy' became part of my musical DNA early on. If I could hear both songs once a day, I'd still never tire of either of them.

Rounding out the set there's a fun tip of the hat to **Cream** on 'Blues - Part II'. Before once again the familiar strains of the Satie's 'Variations On A Theme' draws the curtain to a close. I believe this to be one of the best pop albums the 1960's produced.

## In Summary
Upon release of the record, Blood Sweat And Tears quickly became headliners with a fledgling **Jethro Tull** as opening act. They also attained a top spot at the Woodstock Festival.

'Spinning Wheel' and the LP were both nominated for Grammys with the album winning record of the year. They charted a few more hits before Thomas left in 1972, refusing to endure persistent tensions between the pop half of the band and its jazz contingent.
