## Background
Today we're looking at the debut Argent album. From 1969, its been considered one of the significant jigsaw pieces of the early prog puzzle.

As this review is being written up, we are also doing a joint article on Argent's second album 'Ring Of Hands', released in 1970. This is because both albums were reissued as a 2 on 1 CD. Some people may have that disc, and may also appreciate the two being a package deal. 

The three guys who were the cornerstones of the band were Rod Argent, guitarist Russ Ballard and producer Chris White.

Argent and White began their partnership with **The Zombies** as far back as 1962. Their last studio album 'Odyssey And Oracle' came out on 1968. It wasn't successful, and Rod was itching to move into the burgeoning prog space.

This debut album was released in November 1969. It wasn't an immediate stunner, that accolade would eventuate years later upon reflection by historians and curious punters. 

## The Songs
For a first effort, there are some totally likeable songs here. Seven of which are White/Argent co-writes, three are Ballard compositions.

'Like Honey' kicks off with a wistful entrance. If you listen close enough you can hear faint traces of **Queen**. Particularly on the vocal parts. 

'Liar' has some slower moments but the chorus definitely crashes the party. No real drum work to speak of, other than the cymbal crashes on the aforementioned chorus. **Three Dog Night** eventually made a hit single if this track year's later. 

'Be Free' takes a carefree (excuse the pun) approach. Rod's organ work is more prominent on this Ballard written track. 

'Schoolgirl' features a high quotient of piano, especially of the barroom variety. The tip-tappy piano parts dominate this one.

'Dance In The Smoke' is considered by some to be an album highlight. The harmony vocals are a feature. The guitar work is understated for the majority, but comes alive on the chorus and solo sections. The organ solo at the end is also very good. 

'Lonely Hard Road' combines prog with a tendency to swing toward a classic 60's hard rock direction. 

'The Feeling's Inside' is laden with some cathedral like organ work. It reminds me of **Cressida** though not as poppy. I do like this one though.

'Freefall' features electric piano (wurlitzer possibly). This is definitely a product of the late 60's. Check out some of those high octave vocals too.

'Stepping Stone' ups the ante somewhat. Lots of cymbal crashing going on. The song moves along briskly, though the piano outro is very subdued and in contrast to what went before.

The closer 'Bring You Joy' finishes up as a ballad. Its not totally somber and tearjerky, and does perk up eventually. The lead vocal heads into the clouds throughout. It does have a quirky aspect when it gets going. The mid section with piano and a slower than slow tempo nearly turns it into a jazz standard.

## In Summary
As mentioned, the first Argent record would not break debut world records. However, it would lay the foundations for all the next records to follow, up until about 1975. The album has received several reissues, refer to the Discogs link above.
