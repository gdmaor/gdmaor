## Background
When is a Beatles album not a Beatles album? Well, when it's 'Yellow Submarine'. What you get for your money is just one side of Beatles songs, and the other the orchestral score, composed by **George Martin** from the wonderfully trippy animated film of the same name.

## The Songs
As for the Beatles songs it's a case of the title track which by this time was some 3 years old, and 'All You Need Is Love' from 1967, a couple of throwaways 'All Together Now' and 'Hey Bulldog', but it's saved by the absolutely storming psychedelic George Harrison rocker 'It's All Too Much', which alone is worth the price of the album.

## In Summary
The film score side is in itself a perfectly charming side of light orchestral pop. It's a bit of a curio within the Beatles catalogue, but nevertheless it works for me. An album that was essentially a stop-gap, and a contractual obligation may I add, making way for the last two Beatles releases, one being a masterpiece, and the other.. hmmm well not so much.
