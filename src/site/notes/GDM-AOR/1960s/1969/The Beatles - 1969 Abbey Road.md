## Background
The last Beatles album to be recorded, although not the last to be released, that honour would go to 'Let It Be'. By this time the band were in all sorts of trouble.

There were arguments over who should manage the band. McCartney was at odds with the other three, and there was tension over the recording process.

It was finally decided that George Martin would, once more produce the band but with a proviso. They would allow Martin to produce the record similarly to earlier albums and that strict discipline would be adhered to. This method obviously worked as this is arguably their very best album.

## The Songs
What is it that makes 'Abbey Road' such a musical masterpiece? Well, for a start there was the sheer breadth of the musical vision.

Secondly there was the 'off the scale' readings of the band's collective musical imagination. And all this at a time when The Beatles were coming to the end of their time together. 

The result was staggeringly beautiful. It was a testament to the songwriting skills of McCartney and Lennon. Also, it finally gained George Harrison equal footing as a composer. 

'Something' (the first Harrison song on the A-side of a Beatles' single) and 'Here Comes The Sun' represent his greatest achievement. They are highlights of 'Abbey Road' rather than secondary songs of limited importance on previous albums.

Along with Harrison's contributions, the album has two great Lennon tracks 'Come Together' and one of the best Beatles hard rock pieces 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)'. McCartney had taken the lead in the group from a recording production standpoint, offers 'Oh Darling' and 'You Never Give Me Your Money'.

The harmonies of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison on 'Because' are astoundingly beautiful. But it's the 16 minute Medley (track listing #9 - 17') which acts as the culmination of all things Beatles. A stunning climax to an unequalled string of successes and superlative albums.

## In Summary
This album is a fitting end to the greatest band ever. Yes I know there are still arguments raging over who that accolade. Let's just remember that the 60's was a decade of change and finally an awakening for the post WWII era.

Not just in musical terms but also in socio-cultural terms as well. The Beatles influence on music has been well documented, but I think, and it's just my opinion of course, that their influence went far beyond that. 

They changed the world (for better or for worse), and the landscape, musical or otherwise has never been the same since. Oh, and finally let's not forget the iconic album artwork. I've still yet to visit and have my photograph taken there, but it's on my bucket list.
