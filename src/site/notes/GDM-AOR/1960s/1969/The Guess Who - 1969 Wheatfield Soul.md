## Background
In several ways 'Wheatfield Soul' represented a seismic shift for The Guess Who. The band noved away from the garage rock of the previous three albums. Instead, they shifted into psychedelic pop territory,

It's the first time without lead vocalist Chad Allen who was replaced by new boy Burton Cummings. It was also the first LP not recorded in Minneapolis, Minnesota, a city that played an important role in the Winnipeg based band's early history.

Produced by Jack Richardson at A&R Studios in New York, the album wasn't a big hit but it unleashed what is truly one of the greatest singles of the 1960's.

## The Songs
A co-write between Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings, 'These Eyes' is heaven sent. Seriously, I'm not an emotional guy but on a chilly North Dakota hillside in 2000, The Guess Who opened their set with this tune. I was almost brought to tears. From the beautiful electric piano melody to Cummings impassioned vocals and light orchestration, its pop perfection with a capital P.

Unfortunately the rest of the album is something of a mixed bag with The Guess Who clearly searching for a sound of its own. 'Pink Wine Sparkles In The Glass' references **The Beatles** and the **Bee Gees**. But it's 'I Found Her In A Star' with Bachman's fuzzed-out guitar that set the synapses alight and in my opinion this would have made for a great single.

At the time Cummings was a big Jim Morrison fan and the weird 'Friends Of Mine' sounds very much like **The Doors**. It has even more **Beatles** references and running way too long at 10 minutes. Wacky stuff and not their finest moment.

However, I do like the sweet jazzy pop of 'A Wednesday In Your Garden'. Then there's the **Gordon Lightfoot** tribute 'Lightfoot' which sounds just like the man. Sitar, Tabla and medieval chants work their way into the oddball 'Love And A Yellow Rose'.

However, my money is on the **Nilsson** meets **Paul McCartney** jewel 'Maple Fudge'. The slinky 'We're Coming To Dinner' closes the album on a mediocre note. While 'Wheatfield Soul' is an uneven album I reckon there's enough flashing lights to indicate that The Guess Who were going places.

## In Summary
I would also like to add, that the Iconoclassic reissue is well worth seeking out. This version adds the trippy pre-LP single 'When Friends Fall Out' and the bluesy 'Guess Who Blues'. That one features some red hot guitar from Bachman not forgetting the **Otis Redding** send-up 'Of A Dropping Pin'.
