## Background
Probably the most written about album in the history of Rock music.. period. 'Sgt Peppers..' is an album, along with **The Beach Boys** 'Pet Sounds' changed the course of popular music forever.

That's not to say it's the greatest album in rock history - of course it isn't. And for that matter it's not even the best Beatles album. That honour is a tossup between 'Revolver' and 'Abbey Road'. But with its outrageous production and arrangement values, iconic sleeve design and clever concept it stands out.

This was released at a time of cultural awakening, things wouldn't quite be the same ever again.

This album more than any other was played incessantly n my house in the 60's courtesy of my older brother. Although not fully appreciating all its nuances then, I was enthralled by it too. This coming June 2017 'Sgt Pepper..' will celebrate its 50th Birthday so what better time to review this classic.

## The Songs
Ridding themselves of the burden of touring, The Beatles put all their considerable talents and efforts into the studio. They pushed forward barriers like never before.

This resulting album was a bewildering mix of psychedelia, whimsical music hall, Indian musings and early progressive rock. And also, not without The Beatles uncanny knack of writing enduring pop songs too.

Never before had the record buying public been subjected to an assault on their already somewhat shredded senses. 'Sgt Pepper..' is generally seen as a concept album, but not so for me. It's rather a collection of songs cleverly woven together to make one continuous piece of music. It's a testament to not just the Beatles but also the genius of producer George Martin. He, along with the band took what technology they had at their disposal to its very limits.

Songs such as 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds' and 'Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite' positively glow. The epic 'A Day In The Life' is a cleverly spliced together piece and is the Beatles at their most inventive. Lesser known tracks 'Fixing A Hole' and 'Getting Better' are a hark back to the earlier, simpler Beatles music. They are full of those typically infectious hooks.

Along the way there are a couple of duffers too. George Harrison's Indian influenced jaunt 'Within You, Without You' is a track that truthfully outstays its welcome. While 'Good Morning, Good Morning' smacks of filler, but everywhere else there are classics a plenty.

There's the vibrant title track and the (now) standard 'With A Little Help From My Friends'. Even with Ringo's nasally vocals it's still a charmer. Not forgetting the _comfy as an old pair of slippers._ 'When I'm Sixty Four'. Overall, 'Sgt Pepper..' is still a piece of art that delivers on multiple levels.

## In Summary
50 years old and showing definite signs of aging, it's classed as one of the most important albums ever released. A standard had been well and truly set. With this album, The Beatles left most of their contemporaries floundering in their (considerable) wake.

Best heard in its original mono (although I will be getting the 50th-anniversary edition which has been given the usual 5.1 once over by George Martin's son Giles). This version is how the band made it, and for me the best way to hear it too. 'Sgt Pepper..' is an album that was not only musically significant but also culturally too. Epoch-making.
