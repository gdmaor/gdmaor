## Background
Released as an EP in the UK in late 1967, but made into a full album sometime in the 70's to fall into line with the rest of the world. This was seen by many as The Beatles first misstep, but I disagree, as the songs on here are as good as anything the band ever produced.

A lot of the flak comes from the film of the same name, it was called amongst other things self-indulgent and nonsensical, but even now it's cited by the likes of **Steven Speilberg** as an important milestone in movie making, but it's the music we're really interested in here.

## The Songs
The band had earlier in the year released 'Penny Lane/Strawberry Fields Forever' as a single and its vision and production values were quite incredible and 'Magical Mystery Tour' carries on very much in that vein.

The title track is a glorious burst of power-pop, 'The Fool On The Hill' is a fine slice of McCartney at his winsome best, and the George Harrison penned 'Blue Jay Way' is an early sighting of psychedelia, but it's left up to John Lennon with his 'I Am The Walrus' opus that catches the ear. It's wonderful, crazy lyrics and as always with the band an incredible arrangement and performance.

## In Summary
The initial 6 tracks on the EP were further bolstered by the singles released by the band around that time and yet again demonstrate a band at the very heights of their powers in every single way.
