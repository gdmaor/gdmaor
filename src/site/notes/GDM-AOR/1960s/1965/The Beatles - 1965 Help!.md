## Background
The soundtrack (of sorts) to the Beatles second film was released in August 1965, and sees them getting back on track. Aside from covers of 'Dizzy Miss Lizzy' and 'Act Naturally' it's all original compositions again.

The title song is, after all these years still an absolute joy, and 'Ticket To Ride' displays a more mature approach that was starting to develop within their songwriting.

## The Songs
I can't review this album without mentioning McCartney's 'Yesterday', which came to him in a dream of all things, and is I believe still the most covered song of all time and love it or loath it, has stood the test of time.

Again with most (if not) all of their albums there are still some classics that I've not even mentioned yet. Just thinking of the likes of 'You've Got To Hide Your Love Away' and 'You're Going To Lose That Girl' both songs that are so simple in their execution, yet so devastatingly brilliant. 

## In Summary
The film itself was another joyous romp, and for a lot of people, myself included getting to see the band in glorious colour for the first time, back then it was Black and White TV's folks, so the chance to see them on the big screen and in colour was breathtaking, and it's hard to get across to people who weren't around at the time the impact that The Beatles had on society as a whole.
