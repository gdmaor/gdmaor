## Background
This album sees the band, quite incredibly move up yet another few gears. The sophistication that had started to develop on 'Help!' really began to blossom. With the likes of 'Norwegian Wood' and the first appearance of the Sitar as an instrument. 

It raised some eyebrows, as did the introspectiveness of 'Nowhere Man' the gorgeous 'Michelle', and one of my all-time favourite Beatles songs, the reflective 'In My Life' which were all hints of what was to come.

## The Songs
There are of course, still lingering signs of the loveable Mop tops of the earlier albums, there's 'You Won't See Me' and the country tinged 'What Goes On' which sees Ringo getting a rare cowriting credit as well as performing lead vocals. 

'Rubber Soul' was seen, particularly in America as the start of the bands psychedelic period, with **The Beach Boys Brian Wilson** so taken with the album he decided he was going to try and outdo it with his own 'Pet Sounds' opus.

## In Summary
Suffice to say though that 'Rubber Soul' was the first album that the band really started to experiment with different sounds and with a more nuanced approach when in the studio. Their touring days were coming to an end. 

The band were tiring of it all and the feeling that the music was getting lost amidst all the screaming. In retrospect, this album can be seen as their transitional record, leaving behind the innocence of their early works and embracing, although not fully just yet the more adult themes within their music.
