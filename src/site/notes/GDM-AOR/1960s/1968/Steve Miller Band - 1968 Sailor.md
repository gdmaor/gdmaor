## Background
Those of you only familiar with the Steve Miller Band late 70's stadium hits might find this album a bit of a shock to the system. 

'Sailor' was released in 1968 and the San Francisco based outfit, like **Jefferson Airplane** and the **Grateful Dead** were spearheading the sounds and vibes of the west coast counter-culture's kaleidoscope heart.

A popular draw among the Fillmore West crowd, the Steve Miller Band released an astounding 7 albums before scoring a hit single (**REO Speedwagon** anyone?) with 1973's 'The Joker' and yet this LP sold very well considering, eventually turning gold.

## The Songs
Opening with spooky foghorn and lilting organ, 'Song For Our Ancestors' is a forgotten gem of American psychedelia that hints at **Can** styled Krautrock and makes for a wonderful, if slightly strange near six minute listen.

'Dear Mary' is patterned after the British pop sound of the day recalling **The Beatles**, **The Kinks** and the like, punched up with tasty Sgt. Pepper-ish horns.

Very nice and it has to be said this version of the Steve Miller Band had oodles of talent containing no less than four lead vocalists and drummer Tim Davis takes the front and center with the fast paced 'My Friend'.

While 'Living In The U.S.A' was a hit a year later for **Wilmer And The Dukes** although I prefer the original which got a lot of airplay in the 70's when Steve Miller was everywhere on radio. 

'Quicksilver Girl' again sounds very quaint and very English, but from here I find the material slips into a blues rock extravaganza which really doesn't draw me in.

Yes, the cover of **Johnny 'Guitar' Watson**'s 'Gangster Of Love' pops up in the lyric on 'The Joker' single years later, but this version smells suspiciously like filler.

And the two **Boz Scaggs** cuts that round out the album are not even close to the quality of the earlier material and sound nothing like the Boz we know and love.

## In Summary
Scaggs left after the 'Sailor' tour, bound for a lucrative solo career and the Steve Miller line-up continued to change, even including **Journey**'s Ross Valory at one point.

This album is not for everyone, but for a glimpse into the largely unknown past of one of the 1970's most successful bands it's an essential listen, at least three-quarters of it.
