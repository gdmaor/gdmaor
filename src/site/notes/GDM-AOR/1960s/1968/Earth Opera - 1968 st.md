## Background
Earth Opera are not the usual fare we feature on Glory Daze. But I thought it was about time to flesh out some really old releases from before the 70's. Here's one that is as quirky, as it is psychedelic, folky and prog, all rolled into one. They were the Boston based combo Earth Opera, who definitely came from left field.

The band released two albums in their brief tenure. But before you knew it, Earth Opera had concluded their run before the 1960's had even clocked off! Maybe they found that they couldn't topple Apollo Eleven and the July 1969 moon mission in the popularity stakes.

## The Songs
Earth Opera's formation came from the pairing of Peter Rowan and David Grisman, who gave birth to EO back in 1967. Both men were active folk musicians, and the combination of similar ideals led to their debut on Elektra Records a year later.

The album is the complete folk rock meets bluegrass meets psychedelic. Though I think personally it leans more to the folk side of the road. Their homage to their hometown is reflected in the lyrics to opener 'The Red Sox Are Winning'. Then there's the harpischord madness to 'Dreamless'. Very strange, lol!

'Home Of The Brave' is very wacky and whimsical. 'The Child Bride' brings the vibraphone to the fore. Time And Again' is probably the album's heaviest moment. While closer 'Death By Fire' is a sure copy-cat to labelmates **The Doors**, of whom EO used to support quite a bit during this timeframe.

## In Summary
The album doesn't reach any great crescendo in terms of upbeat action and tempo. It prefers instead to command the middle ground. Both their albums received CD reissues from Wounded Bird during 2001 and 2002. If you're feeling slightly adventurous, Earth Opera might be a band to check out.
