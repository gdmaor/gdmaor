## Background
A huge sprawling epic and The Beatles first on their own Apple label. It is an album that I think that the first real cracks within the band started to appear. There were rumours of Ringo walking out of the sessions. 

He was eventually cajoled back by the other three members, and it was also becoming clear that the partnership writing team of Lennon and McCartney was now starting to work individually.

I, along with a lot of others at the time of release think this would have made a brilliant one disc album, but a double? No, far too much filler for me, even producer **George Martin** felt very much the same.

## The Songs
The good bits, well there's the raw sounding 'Back In The USSR' and the proto-metal of 'Helter Skelter', as well as the tender 'Martha, My Dear', and 'Julia', and of course the now iconic Harrison penned 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. 

But it's on the likes of 'Rocky Racoon' and the frankly irritating 'The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill' that I found my attention wandering. It's here that the album becomes a bit of an unfocused mess, and do we really need the likes of 'Why Don't We Do It In The Road?, 'Piggies' and 'Revolution 9', I think not.

## In Summary
I may be being overly harsh, and history has been rather kind to the album, with it now viewed as one of the bands best, but for me overall a bit of a disappointment.
