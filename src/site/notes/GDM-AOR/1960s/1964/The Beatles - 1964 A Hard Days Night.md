## Background
From the film of the same name, or is it the other way around? 'A Hard Day's Night' sees The Beatles really hit their creative stride. A full album of originals which back then was unheard of. 

Released, once again a mere 8 months after 'With The Beatles', but this time showing no signs of fatigue, hell they even managed to take part in the film of the same name during that time period, which really does seem incredible by today's standards## 

## The Songs
The first seven songs make up the soundtrack to the film, with the Iconic title track as well as the gorgeous 'If I Fell', and the full-on power pop of 'Can't Buy Me Love' and 'Tell Me Why'.

The second side (in old money), is just as good with classics everywhere, 'Any Time At All' and 'You Can't Do That', to name but two, there's not a single track that could be considered as filler.

## In Summary
This album really did in terms of creativity turn it up a few notches and frankly left most of their contemporaries floundering in their wake.

As for the film itself is was effectively a day in the life of the band cleverly put together by director **Richard Lester** which also set new standards, and was one of my own earliest musical memories, and had me enthralled from the off.
