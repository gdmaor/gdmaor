## Background
An album that sees the band returning to including cover versions as well as a plethora of their own wonderful original material but I believe overall suffers somewhat from the choices of covers which gives the album a 'Stop/Start' sort of feeling.

This was the band's fourth album release in just 21 months and coupled with the intensive touring schedule they were undertaking as well, it's hardly surprising that the quality would at times suffer slightly.

## The Songs
There are of course some classics here, there's 'I'll Follow The Sun', which shows McCartney off in all his glory, and the sublime 'Eight Days A Week' with its hand firmly on the Power Pop driving wheel.

It's also generally seen as a more downbeat release as opposed to the happy, upbeat releases prior to this, which could have been down to them feeling jaded, but it's also worth noting that this is the first sign of a more introspective, personal approach from the band, notably in Lennon's 'I'm A Loser' and 'No Reply'.

## In Summary
I see this as an album of the band treading water somewhat, not a bad album in any way, but I find it a more difficult listen due to, as I said previously the choice of cover versions.
