## Background
Incredibly, this album saw yet another step up in quality. By this time The Beatles had fully embraced the potential of the recording studio. The experimentation that has tentatively started on 'Rubber Soul' was now in full swing, but apart from that it's in the song writing department that's the most startling.

## The Songs
Everywhere you look here there's a classic. There's the mournful yet beautiful 'Eleanor Rigby', the childlike yet charming 'Yellow Submarine', and the power-pop glory that is 'And Your Bird Can Sing', there's just not a single sign of filler here, but it's on the closing track 'Tomorrow Never Knows' that a giant leap for the band is taken. With its pioneering use of sampling, tape manipulation and other production techniques, the record-buying public at that time had heard nothing quite like it.

## In Summary
By now the band had also begun experimenting with various substances and this would lead them onto heightening the scope within their writing. The band had also firmly left the lovable Mop Top tag well behind, the touring was about to stop completely and they would exist from then on in as pretty much a studio band.

'Revolver', over the years, has become a fan and critical favourite, but will forever in my opinion live in the shadow of their next album, and with it the world of popular music was about to change forever.
